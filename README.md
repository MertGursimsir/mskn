# THE MSKN - MÄ°SKÄ°NðŸš€
## _Mastering Simplicity, Keying Navigations_
## Welcome to MSKN v1.0!

![](https://github.com/MertGursimsir/mskn/blob/main/MEDIA/image.png)

We present seemingly complex commands through the terminal in a more easily accessible and human-readable format for the user.

 - MSKN is an instruction set program that makes things easier and faster. 
 - The primary purpose of the program is to make quickly accessible the commands under 
     - disk operations, 
     - network operations, 
     - artificial intelligence and 
     - new sub-headings that can be added later based on user feedback.
